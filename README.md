# Bar Recognization

This project is my internship project. 

The project uses IFE blood sample data provided privately, and analyzes the patterns on the bars. 
Project also extracts the image data into structured NumPy array to use in LVQ machine learning, which tests a cognitive approach of LVQ learning rate.
