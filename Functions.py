We are using cutted version of the img. So if you want to see the mid-points on a whole img version,

Use 5 bar finding functions:
smooth, dent, top_bottom, camel, sharp
Then put all into a list and use line eliminator to take the averaged lines

How to take the border 0 to -0?
first find +0 then after is -0 coming?

if left part there is a 0 and some part later -(0) comes?
